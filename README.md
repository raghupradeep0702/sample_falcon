# Subtask 3: Aggregating the results
 
## Purpose:
After all the processes have completed their tasks of summing the numbers within their respective chunks, this step involves aggregating the results from each process to compute the total sum of all the numbers in the original dataset. The aggregated result provides the final output of the computation process.
 
## Instructions:
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install multiprocessing`
2. Run the script: `python sub_task1.py`
 
## Dependencies:
- Python 3.10 or higher
