# Subtask 1: Dividing the data into chunks
 
## Purpose:
The code divides a large array of numbers into smaller chunks to distribute them across multiple processes for parallel processing. This is done to efficiently utilize the available computing resources and speed up the computation process.
 
## Instructions:
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install multiprocessing`
2. Run the script: `python sub_task1.py`
 
## Dependencies:
- Python 3.10 or higher
